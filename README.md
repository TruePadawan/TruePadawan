## Bio
Hey, I'm Hermes, a Computer Science student at the University of Ibadan. I build things primarily with: TypeScript, React.js, Python, Kotlin

I developed an interest in coding some years ago and so far my programming timeline has been:
- Started learning to code with C++ and built up my foundations in programming from there
- [Played with C++ and Qt Framework for a while](https://github.com/TruePadawan/Nipsie)
- [Was interested in Computer Science so I enrolled and completed Harvard's CS50x](https://certificates.cs50.io/704b684e-4a97-4871-a738-e96ce7ffa93b.pdf?size=letter)
- Got exposed to Web technologies while doing CS50x and go into it
- Since then I've dealt with a couple of web related technologies like TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Express.js, TailwindCSS, etc
- Had to use a lot of Python in my first year of University, collaborated with 2 other coursemates to build [Locksmith](https://github.com/TruePadawan/Locksmith)
- Working on making contributions to open source software

There are a couple of technologies I find interesting at the moment:
- Nest.js
- Kotlin
- Game Engines

Other than programming, my interests are [gaming](https://steamcommunity.com/id/hermeschi/), reading (manga/manhwa/fantasy books) and exploring cool technologies  

If you're interested in fantasy books like myself then I suggest these:
- All books by Brandon Mull (I liked Fablehaven and might reread a couple of his books)
- Books by Rick Riordan notably books in the Percy Jackson universe (Percy Jackson, Lost Hero, Trials of Apollo), Sadie and Kane chronicles + Percy Jackson crossover and Magnus Chase series
- Mistborn
- Michael Vey
- The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel
- Stormlight Archive
